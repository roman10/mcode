# Getting Started with mcode

mcode is a desktop IDE for managing multiple autonomous coding-agent sessions simultaneously. It currently supports Claude Code, Codex CLI, Gemini CLI, Copilot CLI, and plain terminal sessions. This guide focuses on first-run usage and core workflows.

For downloads, Homebrew installation, and source-build instructions, see the top-level [README](../../README.md). For a topic-by-topic guide, browse the [User Manual](README.md).

## Prerequisites

- **macOS** (primary supported platform)
- **Node.js** 22+ and **npm**
- **Agent CLIs**, installed only for the session types you want to use:
  - **Claude Code CLI** (`claude` command available)
  - **Codex CLI** (`codex` command available)
  - **Gemini CLI** (`gemini` command available)
  - **Copilot CLI** (`copilot` command available)
- **No agent CLI required** for plain terminal sessions

## Installation

See the [README installation section](../../README.md#installation) for download options, Homebrew, and building from source.

## Launching the App

**Development mode** (with hot reload):

```bash
npm run dev
```

**Production build:**

```bash
npm run build:mac
```

## The Interface

When you launch mcode, you see two main areas:

1. **Sidebar** (left) — icons for sessions, search, changes, stats, and activity
2. **Main area** (right) — a tiling layout (or kanban board) where terminal tiles are displayed
3. **Terminal Panel** (bottom) — a persistent area for plain terminal work, toggled with `Ctrl+` `

### Sidebar

The sidebar has a vertical **activity bar** on its left edge with five icons:

- **Sessions** — session list grouped by date
- **Search** — search in files across project directories (`Cmd+Shift+F`)
- **Changes** — git changes (staged/unstaged) and commit graph (see [Git Changes](git-changes.md) and [Sidebar Panels](sidebar-panels.md#changes))
- **Stats** — commit output, AI cost, and human input metrics (`Cmd+Shift+B`) (see [Sidebar Panels](sidebar-panels.md#stats))
- **Activity** — live event feed from all sessions (see [Sidebar Panels](sidebar-panels.md#activity-feed))

Switch panels by clicking the icons or with `Cmd+Shift+F` (Search), `Cmd+Shift+C` (Changes), `Cmd+Shift+B` (Stats), `Cmd+Shift+A` (Activity).

On the **Sessions tab**, action buttons appear in the sidebar header: Close all tiles, Delete ended sessions, Mark all read, New terminal (`Cmd+T`), and New session (`Cmd+N`).

The session list shows all sessions grouped by date (Today, Yesterday, then by date):

- **Green dot** — Active session (the agent is actively working)
- **Blue dot** — Idle (session is waiting for input)
- **Red dot** — Waiting (e.g., awaiting permission approval)
- **Amber dot** — Starting (session is initializing)
- **Neutral dot** — Detached (PTY connection lost, e.g., after an unclean shutdown; the process may still be running)
- **Gray dot** — Ended (session has terminated)

Sessions with raised attention show a colored left border (red for action, amber for info) to draw your eye. See [Attention & Tasks](attention-and-tasks.md) for details.

You can resize the sidebar by dragging its right edge (200px–500px range).

The **sidebar footer** shows the "mcode" label, today's estimated token cost, an Accounts button, and a [Settings](settings.md) button.

### Tile Toolbar

Each terminal tile has a toolbar showing the session status, label, and uptime. Toolbar buttons:

- **Maximize/Restore** — toggle between a single maximized tile and the full layout (also `Cmd+Enter`)
- **Kill** (square icon) — terminates the session process
- **Close** (X icon) — hides the tile; the session keeps running in the background

Double-click the title in the toolbar to rename the session inline.

## Creating Your First Session

1. Click the **+** button in the sidebar header (or press `Cmd+N`)
2. In the dialog that appears, fill in:
   - **Agent** (required) — choose Claude Code, Codex CLI, Gemini CLI, or Copilot CLI
   - **Working directory** (required) — click "Browse" to select a project folder, or type a path
   - **Label** (optional) — a name for the session; defaults to the folder name
   - **Initial prompt** (optional) — what you want the agent to work on
   - **Model** (Gemini and Copilot, optional) — explicit model name such as `gemini-2.5-pro` or `gpt-4o`; when set, mcode launches the agent with `--model <value>` and stores it on the session so the model pill can render consistently
   - **Permission mode** (Claude only) — controls how Claude handles tool permissions (`default`, `plan`, `acceptEdits`, `auto`, `dontAsk`, `bypassPermissions`)
   - **Effort** (Claude only) — controls reasoning depth (`low`, `medium`, `high`, `max`)
   - **Enable auto mode** (Claude only) — allows the session to use Claude's auto permission mode; off by default (Team plan feature)
   - **Account** (Claude only, shown when multiple accounts are configured) — select which Claude account to use
   - **Run in isolated worktree** (Claude only) — creates a git worktree so the session works on an isolated branch; optional branch name field appears when checked
3. Click **Create Session**

A new terminal tile opens in the main area and the selected agent starts in your chosen directory. Last-used Claude defaults (directory, permission mode, effort) are remembered.

You can also open a plain terminal with `Cmd+T` (the terminal icon in the sidebar header) when you want a shell without launching an agent CLI.

## Working with Sessions

### Interacting with a Terminal

Click inside a terminal tile to focus it, then type as you would in any terminal. The selected agent runs inside the terminal — you can send prompts, approve tool calls, and see output in real time.

### Renaming a Session

Double-click the session name in the sidebar or the tile toolbar to edit it inline. Press **Enter** to save or **Escape** to cancel.

### Closing vs. Killing a Session

- **Close** (toolbar X icon or `Cmd+W`) — hides the tile but the session keeps running in the background. You can reopen it later.
- **Kill** (toolbar square icon or `Cmd+Shift+W`) — terminates the session process. The session moves to "Ended" status.

### Reopening a Closed Session

Hover over the session in the sidebar and click the **+** button to reopen its tile in the layout.

### Resuming an Ended Session

Ended Claude, Codex, Gemini, and Copilot sessions can be resumed in place when mcode has a persisted resume identity for that session.

- **Claude** resumes from its recorded Claude session ID
- **Codex** resumes from its recorded Codex thread ID
- **Gemini** resumes from its recorded Gemini session ID, which mcode resolves back to the current Gemini session list for that working directory
- **Copilot** resumes via `copilot --resume <UUID>` using its recorded Copilot session ID

If resume is unavailable, the ended-session prompt tells you why. For Gemini, the most common cases are:

- no Gemini session ID was recorded for the original session
- the recorded Gemini session ID is no longer present in Gemini's current project-scoped session list

For Copilot, resume requires a captured session ID — if the session ended before the ID was captured (via hook or filesystem polling), resume is unavailable.

In those cases, use **Start New Session** instead of **Resume Session**.

### Context Menu

Right-click any session card in the sidebar to open a context menu with quick actions:

- **Rename** (shortcut: `F2`) — start inline renaming
- **Open Tile** — open the session's tile in the current layout (running sessions)
- **View / Resume** — open a tile for the session's output (ended sessions)
- **Kill Session** — terminate the session process
- **Delete Session** — permanently remove the session record (ended sessions only)

## Tiling Layout

mcode uses a tiling window manager so you can view multiple sessions side by side.

- **Resize tiles** — drag the dividers between tiles
- **Rearrange tiles** — drag tiles to reorder them in the layout
- **Split** — `Cmd+D` (horizontal) or `Cmd+Shift+D` (vertical) to split the focused tile
- **Maximize** — `Cmd+Enter` to toggle a tile between maximized and tiled
- Your layout is automatically saved and restored on next launch

## Command Palette & Quick Open

Press `Cmd+P` to open Quick Open for fast file search across all sessions. Press `Cmd+Shift+P` for the Command Palette to run any command by name. You can also click the project name in the title bar to open Quick Open.

See [Command Palette & Quick Open](command-palette.md) for full details.

## Kanban View

Press `Cmd+Shift+L` to toggle between the tiling layout and a kanban board that groups sessions into columns: Needs Attention, Working, Ready, and Completed.

See [Kanban View](kanban-view.md) for full details.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

Press `Cmd+/` to see the full shortcut reference. A few essentials:

| Shortcut | Action |
|---|---|
| `Cmd+N` | New session |
| `Cmd+T` | New terminal |
| `Cmd+P` | Quick Open |
| `Cmd+Shift+P` | Command Palette |
| `Cmd+1`–`9` | Focus session by position |
| `Cmd+W` | Close tile |
| `Cmd+Enter` | Maximize / restore tile |
| `Cmd+F` | Find in terminal |
| `Cmd+Shift+T` | New task |
| `Cmd+Shift+L` | Toggle layout mode |
| `Cmd+,` | Settings |
| `Cmd+\` | Toggle sidebar |

See [Keyboard Shortcuts](keyboard-shortcuts.md) for the full list, or return to the [User Manual](README.md) to jump to a specific workflow.

## Tips

- Run multiple sessions in parallel to work on different tasks or different repos at the same time
- Use descriptive labels so you can quickly identify each session in the sidebar
- Close tiles you don't need to watch — the session continues running in the background
- Use the `plan` permission mode when you want Claude to propose changes before making them
- Press `Cmd+/` to discover all keyboard shortcuts
- Switch to the Activity tab (`Cmd+Shift+A`) to monitor events across all sessions at once
